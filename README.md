Welcome to the OpenBTS  source code reloaded for 2023 supporting new UHD drivers and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to be compiled against C++11 and C++17.

# What is this project?

This projects provides a GSM+GPRS Radio Access Network Node with Software-Defined Radio.

# Supported hardware

* USRPs:
	* USRP v1 (with 52 MHz clock -> but can be patched for default 64 MHz) 
	* USRP2
	* USRP B200/B210 and B205mini-*
	* USRP N210
	* USRP X3*0
	* USRP N210
* UmTRX
* LimeSDR with OsmoTRX transceiver by now
* ANTSDR E200: Warning! Super experimental as we don't own the hardware yet (send your captures centered on the used ARFCN for debug)

# Quick usage

## Setup

Clone the repository and use the pre-installation script `preinstall.sh` to clone all other projects, submodules and install dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PentHertz/OpenBTS.git
$ cd OpenBTS
$ # Optionally, checkout 5.1.0 branch which is the stable one with `git checkout 5.1.0`
$ ./preinstall.sh # note that for now libcoredumper will show some failures but we quickly bypass them forcing the compilation
```

Once it is finished, you can proceed with the installation of OpenBTS as follows:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-uhd # use different options for other drivers
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

And then we can launch everything!

## Running everything

Preferably run the probe UHD tool to load the firmware and FPGA into the USRP first:

```
$ uhd_usrp_probe 
[INFO] [UHD] linux; GNU C++ version 11.2.0; Boost_107400; UHD_4.1.0.5-3
[INFO] [B200] Loading firmware image: /usr/share/uhd/images/usrp_b200_fw.hex...
[INFO] [B200] Detected Device: B210
[INFO] [B200] Loading FPGA image: /usr/share/uhd/images/usrp_b210_fpga.bin...
[...]
```

You can use `screen`, `tmux` or just laucnh everything except `OpenBTS` in background:

```
$ sudo smqueue &
$ sudo sipauthserve &
$ sudo /OpenBTS/OpenBTS
```

And voil√†!

# Docker container

A Docker images has been also generated for the backup and is ready to use with all installed tools: https://hub.docker.com/r/penthertz/openbts

# Fuzzing with OpenBTS

The Testcall feature has been reintroduced and includes also a SMS Fuzzing features thanks to @Djimmer work, and is under test with this new version of OpenBTS.

You can already test it with the `fuzzing-dev` branch:

```
git checkout fuzzing-dev
```

Do not hesitate to send issue or pull requests in order to stabilize it.

A5/3 support requires installation of liba53.  This can be installed from:
git@github.com:RangeNetworks/liba53.git

Starting with release 4, OpenBTS requires zeromq (zmq).  This can be installed by running:
$ sudo ./NodeManager/install_libzmq.sh

For additional information, refer to http://openbts.org.


These are the directories:

AsteriskConfig	Asterisk configuration files for use with OpenBTS.
CommonLib	Common-use libraries, mostly C++ wrappers for basic facilities.
Control		Control-layer functions for the protocols of GSM 04.08 and SIP.
GSM		The GSM stack.
RRLP		Radio Resource Location Protocol
SIP		Components of the SIP state machines ued by the control layer.
SMS		The SMS stack.
SR		The subscriber registry.
TRXManager	The interface between the GSM stack and the radio.
Transceiver	The software transceiver and specific installation tests.
apps		OpenBTS application binaries.
doc		Project documentation.
tests		Test fixtures for subsets of OpenBTS components.
smqueue		RFC-3428 store-and-forward server for SMS



By default, OpenBTS assumes the following UDP port assignments:

5060 -- Asterisk SIP interface
5061 -- local SIP softphone
5062 -- OpenBTS SIP interface
5063 -- smqueue SIP interface
5064 -- subscriber registry SIP interface
5700-range -- OpenBTS-transceiver interface

These can be controlled in the CONFIG table in /etc/OpenBTS.db.

Standrd paths:
/OpenBTS -- Binary installation and authorization keys.
/etc/OpenBTS -- Configuration databases.
/var/run/ -- Real-time reporting databases.

The script apps/setUpFiles.sh will create these directories and install the
correct files in them.


Releases 2.5 and later include the smqueue SMS server.  It is NOT part of the
normal GNU build process with the rest of OpenBTS.  To build smqueue, go
into the smqueue directory and just type "make -f Makefile.standalone".
