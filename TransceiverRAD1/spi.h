/*
 * defines for the VRQ_SPI_READ and VRQ_SPI_WRITE commands
 *
 * SPI == "Serial Port Interface".  SPI is a 3 wire bus plus a
 * separate enable for each peripheral.  The common lines are SCLK,
 * SDI and SDO.  The FX2 always drives SCLK and SDI, the clock and
 * data lines from the FX2 to the peripheral.  When enabled, a
 * peripheral may drive SDO, the data line from the peripheral to the
 * FX2.
 *
 * The SPI_READ and SPI_WRITE commands are formatted identically.
 * Each specifies which peripherals to enable, whether the bits should
 * be transmistted Most Significant Bit first or Least Significant Bit
 * first, the number of bytes in the optional header, and the number
 * of bytes to read or write in the body.
 *
 * The body is limited to 64 bytes.  The optional header may contain
 * 0, 1 or 2 bytes.  For an SPI_WRITE, the header bytes are
 * transmitted to the peripheral followed by the the body bytes.  For
 * an SPI_READ, the header bytes are transmitted to the peripheral,
 * then len bytes are read back from the peripheral.
