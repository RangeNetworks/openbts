Installation Requirements



OpenBTS compiles to a simple Unix binary and does not require special
installation.

One some systems (Ubuntu), you will need to define LIBS = -lpthread prior to
running configure.

To run OpenBTS, the following should be installed:

	Asterisk (http://www.asterisk.org), running SIP on port 5060.

	libosip2 (http://www.gnu.org/software/osip/)

	libortp (http://freshmeat.net/projects/ortp/)

	libusrp (http://gnuradio.org).
	This is part of the GNURadio installation.
	It is the only part used by OpenBTS.


OpenBTS logs to syslogd as facility LOG_LOCAL7.  Please set your /etc/syslog.conf
accordingly.


For information on specific executables, see tests/README.tests and
apps/README.apps.

See http://gnuradio.org/redmine/wiki/gnuradio/OpenBTS/BuildingAndRunning for more
information.
